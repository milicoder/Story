Maybe I’ll make pasta. Add chilies to it.

Mary was alone again on a Saturday. Her father, Harold was on another business trip to Mississippi, and the house was all to herself, which meant she could have pasta every day if she wanted.

Her medicine for lowering her testosterone levels made her gain weight, and her father was not keen on her pasta indulgence.

I can add tuna too. Some mozzarella. It was so quiet in the house, her thoughts sounded like they were being spoken out loud. In the town of Woodway, Washington, there’s not much to hear besides birdsong and the rumble of an occasional car.
